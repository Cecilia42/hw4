For the mid term project, I also want to do a little game about Gluttonous Snake.
At the begining of the game, there will be a tiny snake,and a dot. The snake needs to eat the dot in order to grow longer.
The player needs to use the arrow on the keyboard to control the snake to eat the dot. As long as the snake grow longer,
the game will be come harder. The snake cannot touch his body, and when the snake succfully ate the dot, another dot will
come out. As the game become harder, it may appear two dots on the screen for the snake to eat. When the snake eats the dot,
it will have a sound in order to tell the player he gets the point, and when the snake touchs his body, the game is over and
the player will receive his score for the game, one dot equals to one point. The player can view his socre on the up right 
corner, and the best sore.
