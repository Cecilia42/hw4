For the mid term project, I want to do a sketching game, with sound. and I have two ways to do this idea.
First way is let compture draw by itself. When I click the mouse, the computer will draw 
the image. Since everytime I click the mouse the computer will draw something, after a few times, the computer
will draw a complete picture.
Another way is I can upload some pictures, when I click the mouse, the picture will drop from the top of the screen.
As long as it drops, if the controler press the arrows on keybord, the image will move with the arrow in order to 
complete the picture. 
If I am going to do the first way, I will let the computer draw some simple drawings, like clouds, grass, and house. 
If I am going to do the drawing in second way, I will choose some small pictures and put them into different layer
and make the drawing like tetris.
